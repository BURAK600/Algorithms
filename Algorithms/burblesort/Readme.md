# Burble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case time complexity is quite high.

## Time Complexity of Burble Sort

Bubble Sort is an easy-to-implement, stable sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n²) in the average and worst cases – and O(n) in the best case.
